General description



Distribution of Hornbills

Hornbills are found in ------
Southeast Asia countries like India, 
Myanmar, Bangladesh, Butan, Nepal, 
Thailand etc., Africa with some in 
North America and South Europe.  

In Bangladesh, 4 - 5 hornbills species 
are found in hilly areas like 
Chittagong hill tracts and Sylhet

IUCN red list: critically endangered   
(mostly)

Casque:
 A  hollow or spongy structure made 

out of keratin. 

 It is believed that this structure acts as 
a vibrating chamber to make the 
hornbill's voice louder. 

 The calls made by the bird range from 
deep booming sounds as they begin 
foraging to brays, toots, bellows, and 
cackles.

Casque of hornbill

Fig: Rhinoceros hornbill casque anatomy



The weight of a hornbill's casque and bill are so 
heavy that their first two neck vertebrae are 
fused to support the weight.

Some hornbill species apply makeup! Their bill 
is stained red-yellow and orange by preening 
oil from a gland at the base of their tail. 

Southern ground hornbill booms are so loud 
they are sometimes mistaken for the roaring 
of lions.

Other special features

Fig: Southern ground hornbill 



They are diurnal and fly with pair or in a 
small group but they roost in a large group 
for safety.

They mainly roost in the holes of the tree 
and females are sealed up the hole 
entrance (with the regurgitated food, 
droppings and mud) remaining a small hole 
during egg lay and incubation. At this time, 
male bring the food and feed the female 
through the hole upto chicks are half 
grownup.

But in case of ground hornbill, the don’t seal 
the entrance and both parents incubate the 
eggs and feed the chicks.

Roosting and Social behavior

through hole



Hornbills are omnivorous and live on tree 
fruits, insects and small animals.

Northern hornbill and Southern ground 
hornbill are carnivorous and eat mice, 
other rodents, frogs lizards and snakes.

The beak is longer than the tongue, so the 
they toss it back to throat with a jerk of 
head.

In feeding, they build a  relationship with 
mongooses, monkey, elephant etc.

Daily feed consumption: 300-500 gm

Feeding of Hornbill



Most of the hornbills are monogamous and 
choose partner for life time. The male have to 
build trust by demonstrating his devotion by 
bringing foods.

Sexual maturity: 1year (small), 2-3 years 
(medium) and 3-6 years (large)

The females lay egg upto 2 (in larger species) – 8 
(in smaller species) 

incubation period is 23 (small)-64 days (large)

The chicks are born naked and pink colored with 
closed eyes. The they fledges after 2 months and 
separate from parents in 4 months 

Reproduction 

Fig: chick of hornbill (grey HB) 



Mainly hornbill restrains with physical method. It is like the parrot restraining 
procedures. But ensure-
Room entrances are closed
Blind the eyes
Bills are closed with tap or elastic band

(As they have serrated upper jaw)
Towel can be used

Chemical restraining: rarely done. It can be done by diazepam (0.5-2mg/kg) or 
xylazine (1-2.2mg/kg). And general anesthesia with ketamine (20-50mg/kg 
alone or 10-20mg/kg  IM with diazepam/xylazin) or prpfofol IV.
Anesthesia: general anesthesia. Good with gaseous anesthesia (isoflurane) than 
injectable anesthesia
